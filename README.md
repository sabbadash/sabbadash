  <summary><b>A bit of story</b> (click to expand)</summary><br>
  
  🖥️  My passion for technology started in childhood when I would tinker with an old PC alongside my father. He taught me the PC's inner workings as we fixed and replaced parts and wires. This experience lighted up my curiosity, leading me to disassemble and reassemble computers on my own, either to upgrade components or simply for fun😄

  🖲️  My journey continued with Arduino, where I delved into programming microcontrollers. I enjoyed experimenting with LEDs, displays and sensors. One memorable project involved ordering a special shield for Arduino from China and downloading software from the web to create a device capable of disrupting Wi-Fi signals. It worked so well that I even brought it to school once, playfully interrupting friends' Wi-Fi hotspots.🤫

  Subsequently, I discovered C++ and object-oriented programming, creating console applications that were working with files. Moving forward, I explored C#, Windows Forms, and Unity, where I developed windowed applications and even created a simple clicker game on Unity.

  Driven by a profound interest in creating my own software, I ventured into diverse technologies. I was learning databases, Python, Java, and even PHP, all of which have been avenues for fun and learning, providing me with a foundation in programming.

  Now I am focusing on Next.js. Embracing this beautiful framework, I am committed to mastering its capabilities to build modern and cool websites.
